We now have full support for filters. You can create filters in a number of ways.

class YourController < Controller

   # before_action, after_action, around_action, before_result, after_result, authorized_action, exception_action all work
   before_action :index do |context|
     # do some filtering stuff here
   end
   
   around_result :index do |context|
     # do some result filtering stuff here
   end
   
   before_action :index, :method_filter
      
   authorized_action :some_other_action do |context|
     # do some authorization checking work here
   end
   
   filter :index, YourFilter
   filter :some_other_action, DifferentYourFilter
   
   # executes for each action
   filter YourControllerFilter 
   
   def index
     # index action
   end
   
   def some_other_action
     # index action
   end
   
   def method_filter
    # do some filter stuff here
   end

end

You can define the following types of filters:
ActionFilter, ResultFilter, AuthorizationFilter, ExceptionFilter

class YourFilter < ActionFilter

  def on_action_executing(context)
    # Do some filter work here
  end
  
  def on_action_executed(context)
    # Do some filter work here
  end
end
